### Starting Research Proposition
* I am visualizing entrepreneurial ecosystems by geographic cluster because I want to better predict where, how, and why new clusters may emerge in order to help policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs with allocating resources, growing the economy, and creating meaningful work.

### Crowd-Intelligence exercise, turned up some the following ideas:
* VC As Caste System -- further research is ongoing
* Historical versus Modern Entrepreneurs (What's changed?)
* An visualization and analytics tool for policy makers, entrepreneurs, investors
* Asymmetry of Social Impact Investors versus Traditional VCs
* Hypothetical scenarios based on different conditions
* A reorganized, Graph Database/ Network for a new perspective into the ecosystem
